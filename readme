NSE vs. BSE Real-Time Arbitrage Dashboard

A real-time dashboard built with Python and Streamlit to monitor and compare the stock prices of dually-listed companies on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). This tool helps identify potential arbitrage opportunities by calculating the price difference in both absolute and percentage terms.

The application connects directly to the Angel One SmartAPI to fetch live, ticking market data.
‚ö° Features

    Real-Time Price Fetching: Connects to the Angel One SmartAPI to get live Last Traded Price (LTP) for stocks on both NSE and BSE.

    Arbitrage Calculation: Automatically calculates the price difference in both Rupees (‚Çπ) and percentage (%).

    Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.

    Dynamic Filtering & Sorting:

        Filter stocks by a minimum percentage difference to hide insignificant gaps.

        Sort the table by the largest price difference (‚Çπ or %) to quickly spot opportunities.

        Customize the number of stocks to display.

    Visual Heatmap: The "Difference" columns are color-coded (Red-Yellow-Green) to visually emphasize the magnitude of the price gap.

    Secure Login: Requires Angel One credentials, including TOTP, for secure access to the API.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

    Language: Python

    Dashboard: Streamlit

    Data Manipulation: Pandas

    API Integration: Angel One SmartAPI, Requests

üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.
1. Prerequisites

    Python 3.8+

    An active Angel One trading account with SmartAPI access enabled.

    Your Angel One API Key, Client ID, Password/PIN, and a TOTP-generating app (like Google Authenticator).

2. Clone the Repository

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-folder>

3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

4. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

(If you don't have a requirements.txt file, run pip install streamlit pandas smartapi-python requests)
5. Generate the Instrument List

The Angel One API uses unique tokens to identify stocks. You need to run a one-time script to generate a master list of these tokens.

python generate_instrument_list.py

This will create an instrument_list.csv file in your project folder.
6. Create the Stock Mapping File

Create a file named bse_nse_mapping.csv in your project root. This file tells the app which stocks you want to track. Add stocks in the following format:

companyName,nseSymbol,bseScripCode
RELIANCE INDUSTRIES LTD,RELIANCE,500325
TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES LTD,TCS,532540
HDFCBANK LTD,HDFCBANK,500180
ICICI BANK LTD,ICICIBANK,532174

You can add as many dually-listed stocks as you want.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application

Once the setup is complete, run the following command in your terminal (make sure your virtual environment is active):

streamlit run app.py

Your web browser will open with the dashboard.

    Enter your Angel One API Key, Client ID, Password/PIN, and a fresh TOTP in the sidebar.

    Click the "Login" button.

    The dashboard will start fetching and displaying live data.

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All controls are located in the sidebar:

    Refresh Rate: Adjust the slider to set how often the data updates (in seconds).

    Number of Stocks to Display: Set the number of stocks from your bse_nse_mapping.csv file to display.

    Minimum Absolute Difference (%): Hides stocks where the price gap is smaller than this value. Set to 0.0 to see all stocks.

    Sort Table By: Sort the table to bring the biggest opportunities to the top.
